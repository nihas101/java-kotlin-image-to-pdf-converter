# Images To PDF Converter [![build status](https://travis-ci.org/nihas101/java-kotlin-images-to-pdf-converter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nihas101/java-kotlin-images-to-pdf-converter)

This is a program for converting images to PDFs with the use of [iText 7](https://itextpdf.com/).

## Features

- Build a single PDF from a directory of images [See here](https://github.com/nihas101/java-kotlin-images-to-pdf-converter/blob/master/README.md#how-to-build-a-single-pdf)
- Build multiple PDFs from multiple subdirectories of images at once [See here](https://github.com/nihas101/java-kotlin-images-to-pdf-converter/blob/master/README.md#how-to-build-multiple-pdfs-at-once)
- Change the order the images will appear in in the final PDF via drag-and-drop or remove them

## Requirements
**Java 1.8** is required to run this program.

## Build Standalone Distribution

To create a standalone distribution as a zip or tar file, run:

```sh
./gradlew distZip
```
or
```sh
./gradlew distTar
```

The distribution is placed under `build/distributions`.

## How to run the converter

To run the program from the distribution, extract the zip or tar file, and run the launch script for your system in the bin folder by typing:
```sh
./imagesToPdfConverter
```
in the command-line interface.
