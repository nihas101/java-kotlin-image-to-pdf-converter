Image2PDF Converter is a program for converting images to PDFs with the use of [iText 7](https://itextpdf.com/).

## Features

- Build a single PDF from a directory of images [See here](https://github.com/nihas101/java-kotlin-images-to-pdf-converter/blob/master/README.md#how-to-build-a-single-pdf)
- Build multiple PDFs from multiple subdirectories of images at once [See here](https://github.com/nihas101/java-kotlin-images-to-pdf-converter/blob/master/README.md#how-to-build-multiple-pdfs-at-once)
- Build PDFs from one or multiple ZIP files of images
- Change the order of the images in the PDF via drag-and-drop and remove unwanted ones

## Requirements
**Java 1.8** is required to run this program.

## Build Standalone Distribution

To create a standalone distribution as a zip or tar file, run:

```sh
./gradlew distZip
```
or
```sh
./gradlew distTar
```

The distribution is placed under `build/distributions`.

## How to run the converter

To run the program from the distribution, extract the zip or tar file, and run the launch script for your system in the bin folder by double-clicking on it or typing either:
```sh
./image2PdfConverter
```
in the command-line interface or
```sh
./imagesPdfConverter --noGUI
```
to run the program in text-mode.
